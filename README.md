My developer profile showcases my major and a little bit about me. It also provides links to my linkedin, github, and two projects I've worked on recently. There's also two helpful links in the footer that provide good resources for learning. I have a second web page that details a little more about my achievements and skills.
Here is a link to my Dev Profile.
